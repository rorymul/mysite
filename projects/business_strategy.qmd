This module was looking at theorectical frameworks that are used in the job of management consultants. It was split into two seperate aspects, the first was a group project with a report worth 35% and a presentation on it worth 15%. While the second aspect was an indivdual case study assignment on Hitachi worth 50%. 

When it came to our group project we did this on Ornua, with a specfic focus on Kerrygold. Which we had an 80% on the report and a 78% on the presentation. You can see the presentation and the report below:
