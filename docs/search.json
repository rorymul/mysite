    "text": "Participating in the Schlesinger Global Family Enterprise Case Competition (SG-FECC) was a defining moment in both my academic and personal development. It was my first time traveling to the United States, and the experience of competing at an international level not only challenged me but also provided invaluable insights into teamwork, strategic thinking, and professional growth.\nOur team represented Dublin City University (DCU) in the undergraduate Oak Division, where we competed against universities from around the world. Over three days, we tackled complex case studies, refining our ability to analyse real-world business challenges under pressure. Through collaboration, strategic discussions, and continuous adaptation, we achieved a perfect score (16 points out of 16) securing first place in our division.\nBeyond the competition itself, the experience was shaped by the people who supported us. Catherine Faherty and Eric Clinton played a crucial role in preparing us for success, providing mentorship, training, and invaluable guidance. Their dedication was instrumental in refining our approach and helping us perform at our best. Additionally, the support from Dublin City University enabled us to take part in this prestigious competition.\nWorking alongside my teammates, David, Sarah, and Evelyn, was one of the most rewarding aspects of this experience. From our initial practice cases to standing at the top of our division, we pushed each other to improve, supported one another in high-pressure moments, and developed a strong sense of camaraderie. The teamwork and problem-solving skills we honed throughout the competition will undoubtedly serve us well in our future careers.\nA special mention must also go to Aiden, who ensured we had everything we needed during our time in Burlington. His role as an ambassador made the experience smoother and more enjoyable, allowing us to focus on performing at our best.\nReflecting on this experience, I recognise how it has shaped my ability to think critically, work effectively in a team, and present solutions with confidence. The opportunity to compete internationally, engage with peers from different backgrounds, and apply my skills in a real-world setting was invaluable. I hope that future DCU students can continue to build on this success and benefit from this incredible learning experience.\nThis competition reinforced the importance of resilience, adaptability, and strategic decision-making, and I am eager to apply these lessons in future academic and professional endeavors. 🇺🇸🏆"

This intensive, week-long program was hosted collaboratively by The Berlin School of Economics and Law, The Drivery innovation hub, and the Startup Incubator Berlin. The bootcamp united passionate students and aspiring entrepreneurs from three esteemed academic institutions: Metropolia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, The Berlin School of Economics and Law, and Dublin City University. This international collaboration provided a vibrant and dynamic atmosphere that encouraged innovation, cultural exchange, and entrepreneurial creativity.\n\nThroughout the bootcamp, I had the opportunity to collaborate closely with a talented, diverse, and highly motivated team of students from Finland and Germany. Together, we addressed pressing sustainability challenges faced by modern cities, exploring ways to foster meaningful and sustainable behavioural change among visitors to Berlin. Partnering directly with the sustainability-focused startup 2zero, our team developed an innovative, incentive-based reward system aimed at promoting eco-friendly practices among tourists. By combining creative problem-solving, user-centric design, and sustainable business models, we aimed to encourage tourists to choose environmentally responsible options during their visits.\n\nAs the project unfolded, I was privileged to take on the responsibility of presenting our solution to an esteemed panel of judges, mentors, and industry experts. After a competitive process, our idea was selected as the winning entry for the 2zero Sustainability Challenge. Achieving this recognition among many innovative projects validated our hard work and affirmed the potential positive impact of our solution in real-world contexts.\nAlthough our days were filled with collaborative discussions and team projects, we also had the opportunity to immerse ourselves in the city and experience its vibrant nightlife. These moments allowed us to build strong connections and foster lasting friendships with everyone involved.\nOverall, the BIP Berlin Entrepreneur Bootcamp was an unforgettable experience, equipping me with practical entrepreneurial skills, intercultural insights, and meaningful relationships that will undoubtedly serve me well in my future career. It reaffirmed my passion for entrepreneurship, sustainability, and international collaboration, marking a highlight of my academic journey."
