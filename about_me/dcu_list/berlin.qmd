I had the incredible opportunity to represent Dublin City University, after being selected amoung 14 other final year business school students, at the BIP Berlin Entrepreneur Bootcamp, an intensive program hosted at The Berlin School of Economics and Law, The Drivery, and the Startup Incubator Berlin. This collaborative initiative brought together participants from Metropolia University of Applied Sciences (Helsinki), The Berlin School of Economics and Law, and Dublin City University, fostering a dynamic environment of innovation, cultural exchange, and entrepreneurship.

Throughout the bootcamp, I worked alongside a talented, diverse team from Finland and Germany, tackling real-world sustainability challenges. Partnering with 2zero, we developed an incentive-based reward system designed to encourage eco-friendly tourism in Berlin. I had the honour of presenting our idea, and Iâ€™m proud to say that we were selected as the winners of the 2zero Sustainability Challenge!

Beyond the intense problem-solving sessions, this experience provided invaluable insights into entrepreneurship and sustainability, while also allowing me to explore the vibrant city of Berlin. It was an unforgettable week that has strengthened my professional and personal growth.
