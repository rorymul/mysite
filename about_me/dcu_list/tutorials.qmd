In the final year of my degree I had the opportunity to serve as a tutorial aid for both firstâ€‘ and secondâ€‘year business students, teaching them skills that I had learnt through my degree to help them with their assignments. I mainly focused on Excel and Power BI tutorials where I would take on some of the tutorials and help teach the students.

When it came to Excel I taugh them how to run a Monte Carlo Simulation on a airlines flights over two years. During this I taught them how to run it with different probabilities for times, and different prices. These tutorials were taught mainly to Accounting and Finance second-years and Business Studies second-years.

I also taught the first-years how to create a Power BI dashboard, where I showed them how to do it on an Irish Housing data set. Showing them how to remove outliers on Power BI without going into the original file and how to do change the different formats.
